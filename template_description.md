Slicer




---------------------------------------------
Patched by the label Weddinger Schule
and can be used without any restrictions. 

This tool allows you to play a sample from 
various starting points, depending on 
the note. It should be positioned before 
the Sampler in your setup. You have the 
flexibility to select the preferred 
position for each white key. The output 
is consistently set to a static C5 note. 
This functionality proves highly valuable 
for resampling drum sequences.
