This audio effect introduces tonal richness 
to the audio signal. At its core, the patch 
features a brief delay that imparts 
a resonating sound pitched to the C-Note. 
Subsequently, the sound is directed through 
a pitch shifter, setting the fundamental 
tone. The resulting signal is then channeled 
through four additional pitch shifters 
(II and IV on the left, III and V on the 
right), each individually adjustable to craft 
chord-like harmonics.

Before reaching the first pitch shifter, 
the incoming signal can be optionally filtered 
through a low or high pass filter. The decay 
parameter contributes additional feedback, 
resulting in a more extensive tonal range and 
prolonged signal duration.
