Virgin




---------------------------------------------
Patched by the label Weddinger Schule
and can be used without any restrictions. 

This is not a genuine modular pitch, but 
rather an initialization preset designed 
for the FMX module. Several compelling 
reasons support the existence of this 
module. While the default preset for FMX 
yields satisfactory results, it may not 
be the optimal starting point for FM sound 
design from scratch. Additionally, 
encapsulating FMX within a metamodule 
streamlines the complex user interface, 
rendering it more accessible.

The metamodule controllers at the top 
level encompass approximately half of 
all FMX module controls, enhancing user 
ease of access. Moreover, they have 
been organized on an 
oscillator-by-oscillator basis rather 
than a function-by-function approach, 
which is more intuitive for sound design 
in many cases.

The default algorithm for Virgin is 
3 -> 4 -> 5 + 1 -> 2. This algorithm 
is highly versatile, incorporating 
numerous widely-used algorithms.
