 **SunVox**

[*SunVox* ](https://warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/)is a small, fast, and powerful modular synthesizer with a pattern-based sequencer (tracker). It is a tool for those people who like to compose music wherever they are, whenever they wish. On any device. On any system. And it's free for most of the systems, except Android and iOS.

**Philosophy**

We're trying to create multi-purpose modules, with a consistent controller paradigm, which are easy to use. The usability of our modules is improved by creative decisions, which are reducing controlling options, defining usable parameter ranges, and improving faster workflows.

**General**

This repository contains development versions of custom modules, which were developed by techno label from Berlin, *Weddinger Schule*.

You can find additional documentation and release versions of some of them on the [label website](https://chat.openai.com/c/insert-label-website-link-here).

**Content**

The root folder of the repository contains module packs: metamodules packed in a metamodule for easy adding to the project.

The file *wsch module development rr.sunvox* is a work-in-progress project, which contains the latest version of all the modules, which are in active development right now.

All the single modules are stored in the following folders:

- *effects*: audio signal manipulation like delays, distortions, etc.
- *instruments*: signal generators
- *tools*: modules, which can't be easily put in one of the above categories, mostly workflow helpers and midi-generators
